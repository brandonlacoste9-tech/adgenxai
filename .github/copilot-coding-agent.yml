onboarding:
  welcome: |
    You're working on adgenxai â€” a Next.js + TypeScript web app (TailwindCSS, Vitest).
    Prefer minimal, well-tested changes. Follow the repo's scripts and quality gates.

  repo_summary: |
    - Framework: Next.js (app/ folder), TypeScript
    - Build: `npm run build`
    - Typecheck: `npm run typecheck`
    - Tests: Vitest (see `vitest.config.ts` and `app/components/__tests__`)
    - Common tasks: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run test`

instructions:
  - role: agent
    description: |
      Make focused changes only after confirming affected files and tests. Prefer
      edits in `app/` and `lib/` unless the issue is config-related. Avoid large
      refactors without opening an issue first.

notes: |
  If you need to make a larger change (refactor, dependency bump, or feature),
  open an issue and propose a small plan; prefer small PRs with green typecheck and build.
